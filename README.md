Welcome to the MeLtcryption edc extensions repository!

This repository should contain custom extensions developed for the "Eclipse Dataspace Connector" to enhance the functionality for privacy-preserving machine learning. As this repository represents the initial transition of custom extensions from a private development environment to a public repository, only the extension for federated learning and encrypted machine learning with a simple CNN has been developed and transferred far enough for presentation. 

**Quick start**
--------------------------------
Make sure that Java 17 is installed and the JAVA__HOME variable is set correctly.
jep (https://github.com/ninia/jep) has to be installed. If not, *pip install jep*.

*WIP* Should be mentioned here: Clone repo (two times for federeated learning), cd edc-extensions, build jar files adapted to the requested setup, machine learning can be started as well
